## Inventory Management System using SQLite & Python


Hello! My name is Saad, and I’m a first-year high school student.
I do coding as a hobby, and I love diving into new projects. This is my first personal project that’s a bit bigger than my usual ones, but honestly,
it was easier than I expected.

## Project Overview

This project is an **Inventory Management System** built with **Python** and **SQLite**.
It’s a simple system that allows you to 
manage product data, including adding, updating, viewing, and deleting product entries from the database.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** The basic Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for managing product data.
- **SQLite Database:** The data is stored in an SQLite database, ensuring everything stays saved even after you close the program.
- **Simple and Efficient:** It’s an easy-to-understand system that's perfect for beginners (like me) to get hands-on experience with databases and Python.

## How to Run

1 Download the main source code file from this repo

2 Run it in any IDE

3 Bonus : if you want to use it onw your own data just change the list in 
          in the start of the program with a list of your choice but make sure that 
          it follows the same parameters that the table has you can ask Chat-GPT to make changes for you

## Why I Made This

I built this project to get a better understanding of how databases work,
and it was a great way for me to practice Python in a real-world context.
Even though it was easy to put together, I’m looking forward to creating something more complex and challenging next time.
I hope others find this useful too!
